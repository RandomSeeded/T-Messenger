## TODO

Thoughts in no particular order:

Most important: need a landing page. Ideally the static assets would be deployed separately, but TBH that's not as essential just yet. It's unclear exactly how you do that yet still make sure the API calls go wherever you want. I imagine everything needs to be hosted on aws for that to work, no?

What does this page look like? Functionality you need:
- Signup (and pay)
- Login? Is this necesssary? Nah...
- About / contact (need a throwaway email that gets forwarded)

TECH: write raw html? write in react? Just do as raw html for now, point is to get shit out there
