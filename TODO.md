## TODO

Thoughts in no particular order:

Most important: need a landing page. Ideally the static assets would be deployed separately, but TBH that's not as essential just yet. It's unclear exactly how you do that yet still make sure the API calls go wherever you want. I imagine everything needs to be hosted on aws for that to work, no?

What does this page look like? Functionality you need:
- Signup (and pay)
- Login? Is this necesssary? Nah...
- About / contact (need a throwaway email that gets forwarded)

TECH: ideally should be react for the frontend, but can be just straight up raw html for now.
Why a framework at all? B/c right now tons of duplicated code across html files. Not the best.
